# soundsynthesis

On this project I really wanted to animate shapes to convey the sound. I used getEnergy() in order to specifically have the shapes change size based on the frequency ranges. Use the arrow keys to move the circle around to change the pitch/tempo.

I really think its interesting that different music slowed down or sped up really changes the "feeling" of the song. DJ Screw created the chopped and screwed genre which was developed in the Houston hip hop scene early 1990s. Music is constantly being changed and altered in new ways that are totally different than the original.
